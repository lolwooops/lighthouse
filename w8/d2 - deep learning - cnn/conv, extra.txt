pooling - shrinks image stack from filtering (convolution)
-pick a window size (2,3)
-pick a stride (2)
-walk window across filtered images
-from ea window take the max value


llimitations
convnets only capture local spatial patterns
-if not image, not as useful
-if data just as useful when columns swapped then convnets not as good
