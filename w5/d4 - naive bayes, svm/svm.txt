support vector machine
used for both classification and regression
more commonly used for classification


support vector classifiers (svc)
use edge points in cluster - midpoint = threshold
distance btw threshold and edge point = margin

largest margin possible = max margin classifier
MMC low bias high var -> doesnt perform well
very affected by outliers

-> allow misclassifications (higher bias but lower var)
allowing misclas = soft margin

use cross valid to determine how many misclassifications and obs inside marginobs on edge and within margin = support vectors


support vector machines
-start with data in low dim
-move data to higher dim
-find svc that sep higher dim into 2 groups

kernel fn - polynomial, radial
polynomial kernal systematically increases dim by setting d (poly degree) and relationships btw ea pair of obs used to find classifier
find d by cv

kernal trick
-kernel fn only calc relationships btw pair of points as if they are in higher dim without actually transforming the data - reduces comp req

svm move data into higher dim space finding high dim svc that can classify obs
