naive bayes
-family of classifiers
-probabilistic ml model used for classification tasks
-based on bayes theorem
	P(A|B) = P(A)P(B|A)/P(B)
-assumes all variables in dataset are naive (not correlated)

divide dataset into 2 parts - feature matrix, response vector


gaussian naive bayes
-continuous values associated with ea feature assumed to be normally dist
