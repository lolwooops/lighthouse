generalized linear model
flexible generalization of ols which allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than normal distribution

glm generalizes by allowing linear model to be related to response variable via link function 
- allow magnitude of variance of ea measurement to be a fn of its predicted value


3 components in glm
-linear predictor - linear combo of parameter b and x
-link fn - links linear predictor and parameter for prob dist
-probability dist - generates the observed variable y

prediction curve is exponential; inverse of log link fn is exp fn

statsmodel library for glm
-endog, exog = X and y

linear regression is a sub- of glm - uses identity link fn (linear predictor and parameter for prob dist are identical) and norm dist

logit fn as link fn and binomial/bernoulli dist as prob dist
-> logistic regression
-as log fn returns values btw 0 and 1, it is a proper link fn for binomial dist


custom glm
typically gml use canonical link fn - uses typical combo of dist and link
-normal dist -> identity fn
-poisson dist -> log fn
-binomial dist -> logit fn

various link fn implemented in sm but need to write for more complex link fn
