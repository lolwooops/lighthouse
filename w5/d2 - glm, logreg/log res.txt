logistic regression
-binary - categorical response only has 2 possible outcomes (sex)
-multinomial logistic regression - 3 or more categories without ordering 
-ordinal logistic regression - 3 or more categories with ordering (movie rating)

linear regression hypothesis
	h(x) = wTx
logistic regression hypothesis generalizes using log fn
	h(x) = g(wTx) where
	g(z) = 1/(1+e^-z) #sigmoid function
	--> h(x) = 1/(1+e^-wTx)

log function has asymptotes at 0 and 1 (x = 0, g(x) = 0.5)


logistic regression decision boundary
manual prediction -> compute vector product wTx
if result of product > 0, predict 1

DB can be non-linear functions


logistic regression parameter (w)
-solve optimizaiton problem


adv
-efficient, straightforward
-low cmp power
-easy implement, easy interpret
-don't need scaling of features
-provides probability score for obs

disadv
-not able to handle large # of categorical features
-vulnerable to overfit
-cant solve non linear problem with log reg - req transformations of non linear features
-will not perform well with indep var that are not correlation to target 
-heavily affect by collinearity
