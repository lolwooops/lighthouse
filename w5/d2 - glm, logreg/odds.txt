odds win = 1/4
-> 1 win, 4 losses (odds = 0.25 win)
NOT the same as "odds ratio"

odds calc from prob
p(lose) = 1 - p(win)
p(win)/p(lose) = odds(win)

log-odds 
makes negative and positive odds symmetrical around 0
-easier to interpret
-easier for statistic

log of prob fn is called logit fn (basis for log reg)
	log(p/(1-p))

log odds is normally distributed
