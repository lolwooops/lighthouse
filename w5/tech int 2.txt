1. explain dev cycle of ml proj

covered most points, talked about ea point in detail
discussion of diff steps


2. normal dist

normal dist -> commonly found in nature, things tend to fall into normal dist
mean and median same, symmetric
bell curve, 1-2-3sd 66
how to test for normal dist
-histogram
-qqplot
-shapiro test


3. central limit theorem vs law of big numbers

central limit -> "not to be confused with law of big numbers"


4. supervised vs unsupervised

-incorporate examples, but more business use case
	-why is svm more appropriate here than not?
	-examples round out interview more
-keep simple


5. how to define # clusters

-elbow, silhouette
-add - subjective decision
-trial and error


6. ml model doesnt give good predictions, will collecting more data help

-is more data always better
-how do you determine if more data is better
	-approximation error -> error = data wont help
-estimation, optimization
-mention maybe linear regression not complex enough
