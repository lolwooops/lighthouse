decision trees
non parametric supervised learning used for classification and regression - learn data to approx curve with a set of "if then else" rules
-builds classification/reg models in the form of a tree structure
-breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets which an associated decision tree is incrementally developed
result -> tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes
