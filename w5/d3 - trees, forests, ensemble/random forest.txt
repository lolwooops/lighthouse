random forest
flexible ml alg that produces good result most of the time - most freq used alg bc of simplicity and diversity - can be used for both classification and regression

create a bootstrapped dataset
-randomly select samples from the original dataset
-allowed to pick the same sample more than once
create decision tree using bootstrapped, but only use random subset of variables at each step
repeat x times - results in a wide variety of trees

-> classify new data with all trees (out of bag dataset)
proportion of samples incorrectly classified = out of bag error

compare out of bag error btw trees, test different settings -> choose most accurate random forest
