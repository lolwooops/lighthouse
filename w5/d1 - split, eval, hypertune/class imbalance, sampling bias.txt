class imbalance

classes in data not equ dist; typically in classification
accuracy paradox 
-acc measures only reflect underlying class distribution

-collect more data
-changing performance metric
-resampling
	-add copies of instances from under rep class called over samp
	-delete instances from over rep class (under samp)
-different alg
-penalized models



sampling bias
sampling bias is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that some members of the intended population have lower sampling probability than overs -> bias sample (non random sample) of population in which all individuals are not equ likely to be selected
