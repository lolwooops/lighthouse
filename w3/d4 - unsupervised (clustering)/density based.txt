dbscan (density based spatial clustering of applications with noise)

clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density. does a great job of seeking areas in data that have a high density of observations, versus areas of the data that are not very dense with obs. good with clusters of varying shapes.

epsilon = max radius of neighborhood
max points = max points in epsilon

core point has at least min points within its epsilon neighborhood including itself (interior)
border point has less than min points but can be reached by the cluster - is in the neighborhood of a core point
outlier = noise, cant be reached



a point y is said to be reachable from x if there is a path from p1 to pn with p1 = x and pn = y where each p on the path must be core points

an object y is directly density reachable from object x if x is a core object and y is in x's epsilon neighborhood


density based clustering 
-pick a random point that has not been yet assigned to a cluster 
	-determine if it is core point; if not, label as outlier
-if it is a core point, then all reachable nodes are assigned to cluster
-do neighbor jumps to keep finding neihgbors until unable to
	-these form the border
-repeat until all are labeled


dbscan vs kmeans
dbscan => effective at cutting noise by labeling them as outliers
kmeans uses entire dataset
