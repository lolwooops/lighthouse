hierarchical clustering
-connectivity based
based on the idea of objects being more related to the nearby objects than to object father away
cluster can be described by the maximum distance needed to connect the parts of the cluster

different distances = different clusters -> dendrogram
dendrogram 
-y axis = distance at which cluster merge
-x axis = objects

agglomerative (bottom up)
-each point is a cluster
-repeatedly combine the two nearest clusters into one

3 questions
-how do you represent a cluster of more than one point
	-centroid (average of its points)
-how do you determine the nearness of clusters
	-cluster distances by distances of centroid
-when to stop combining clusters
	-pick a number k	
	-stop when next merge creates cluster with low cohesion 
	-

-clustroid - data point (from original set) closest to other points
	-treat clusteroid as if it was centroid


-cohesion - diameter of merged cluster - max dis btw points in cluster
	- radius - max dis of point from cluster/clustroid
	- density based approach 





divisive (top down)
-start with 1 cluster and recursively split it
