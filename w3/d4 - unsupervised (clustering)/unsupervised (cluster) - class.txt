unsupervised learning

machine learning is a technique where a computer program acepts inputs and predicts target variable; training alg on sample of dataset
-there is cost/penalty fn, alg tries to reduce this fn as much as possible -> closer to predicitng correct values

less used in industry

dimension reduction, generative networks, clustering

drawing inferences from data which does not have labels (target, y)
not trying to predict a label; group data together on similar attrib

applications 
-marketing/ad targeting
-banking (fraud ccard, credit spending prediction)
-insurance (fraud, risk models)
-social media (fact checking, article classification) 
-medicine (pharm trials, genetic markers)


clustering - creating groups out of data points based on closeness
dividing data into clusters based on centroids, distributions, densities



kmeans
-choose k, number of potential clusters
-initialize cluster centers randomly within data
-instances are clustered to the nearest cluster centre
-centroids of each k clusters become new cluster centers
-repeat until convergence

kmeans shortcomings
-convergence of alg not guaranteed
-number of clusters must be set beforehand

expectation maximum (em)



hierarchial
dendrograms
optimal = longest line

linkage criteria
-how are you going to calc distance btw 

single linkage
-distance btw closest points in ea cluster
complete linkage
-distance btw farthest points in ea cluster
avg cluster
-avg distance btw points in ea cluster



dbscan (density based)
-spherical shape; arbitrary shape; noise
let r be a parameter specifying radius of neighborhood wrt some point and let m be an umber of points we want in a neighborhood to define a cluster

points are classified as core points, border points, and outliers
-core point if at least m points are within distance r of it (including p)
-border point if it is near a core point but doesnt have m points in its r neighborhood
-core point is directly density reachable from another core if it is within distance r from it. 
-point is density reachable from core if there is a path where each is directly reachable; note that this implies that the initial point from all points on the path must be core points
	-all points in this chain path are called density connected
-all points not reachable from any other point are outliers or noise

eps (epsilon) = how far alg looks for points
