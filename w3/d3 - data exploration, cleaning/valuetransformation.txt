value transformation

need data in numeric format, some models work best with normally dist data
-basic trans
-binning
-scaling
-dummy variables

binning very important for 
-decision trees
-interpretability of regression algorithms
	-binning loses information


scaling
bringing all features to same level of magnitudes

standardization
-redistributes features with mean 0 and sd 1
-skl.preprocessing.scale
mean normalization
-dist with values btw -1 and 1 with mean 0
-standardization and mean normalization can be used for alg that assumes 0 centric data like PCA
min-max scaling
-scaling brings value between 0 and 1
unit vector
-done considering whole feature vector to be of unit length
minmaxing and unit vector techniques produces values of range [0,1]



any algorithm that computes distance or assume normality - scale
-knn (knn uses euclidean distance)
-pca (gets features with max variance)
	-high mag features have high var so pca skewed towards high mag
-gradient descent (speed up)
-tree based models (not req)


dummy variables
dummy variable is a numeric variable that represents categorical data 
used to analyze regression equations when one or more indep var are cat
typically dv takes on 2 values 0,1
