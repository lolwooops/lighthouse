outliers
2 main types of outliers
-univariate
-multivariate
-can spot extreme values that don't appear as univariate

reasons for outliers
-data entry errors
-measurement errosr
-experimental errors
-intentional outliers
-sampling errors (sample too small)
-natural outliers


impact of outliers on a dataset
-increase error variance -> reduce power of statistical tests
-bias/influence estimates
-impact basic assumption of regression/other model assumptions

eg outliers massively change mean and sd


how to detect ouliers
-statistical tests
-distance based approaches
-density based appraoches
-visualization


stat tests
-assume that normal data objects follow known dist and occur in high prob region of this dist
-outliers deviate from this dist
-use range (-1.5IQR to 1.5IQR); 5th - 95th percentile; 3 or more sd from mean
	2 main problems with this approach
	-fit data to one of the known dist
	-mean sd and IQR are affected by the outliers (unreliable)

distance based
-judging a point based on distance to neighbors
-assume that normal data objects have dense neighbourhood; outliers far from neighbors
-popular algorithm = knn
	-computes distance to the nearest neighbor of a point x and compares it with the same distance for k nearest neighbors; if distance is significantly higher we consider the point as an outlier

density based
-assume that the density around normal data objects is similar to the density around its neighbors
-outliers have different density
-common technique = LOF (local outlier factor)

visualization
-graphically identify outliers
	-boxplots
	-histograms
	-scatterplot (multivariate)
