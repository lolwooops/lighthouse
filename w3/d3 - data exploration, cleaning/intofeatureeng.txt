feature engineering

better features = more flexibility, better results
-less than optimal/less complex models
	-easier to understand/maintain
-able to choose less than optimal parameters

process of transforming raw data into features that better represent problem to predictive models -> improved model accuracy on unseen data
-performance measures
-framing of the problem
-predictive models
-raw data selected


representation problem: what is the best rep of the sample data to learn a solution to problem

feature importance

feature extraction - the automatic construction of new features from raw data
-auto reduce dimensionality
-PCA

feature selections
-scoring methods: eg, correlation, feature importance
