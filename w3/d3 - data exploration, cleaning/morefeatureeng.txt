feature engineering numeric data

understand features
-raw features = obtained directly from dataset with no manipulation or engineering
-derived features = obtained from FE

-counts
-binarization
-rounding
-interactions
-binning
	-fixed width binning
	-adaptive binning

statistical transformation
-log transform
	-for skewed distributions
	-compresses/reduces values of higher mag
-boxcox transform
	-must be positive (shift with constant)



using ml in feature eng

supervised - output of predic to predict something else
-prediction of mv
	-features without missing values to train predictor of mv
-outlier detection
	-marked outliers in prev obvs

unsupervised - assigning new categories to all obvs
-outlier detection
	-outliers assigned to separate cluster
-feature creation
	-cluster = new var used for prediction
