multidimensional scaling (mds)
-classical (metric) = principal coordinate analysis (pcoa)
-non-metric


PCA -> turn correlation into 2D plot -> highly correlated samples form clusters

mds and pcoa are very similar to pca; convert distances among samples into 2d graph rather than correlations

calculating distances
-euclidean

using euclidean distance = pca graph
== clustering based on minimizing linear distances is the same as maximizing linear correlations


avg of abs value of log fold change





PCA 
= correlations among samples -> math (eigen decomp) -> coords for a graph + percent variation ea axis accs for + loading scores 

MDS 
= distances among samples -> ...""
