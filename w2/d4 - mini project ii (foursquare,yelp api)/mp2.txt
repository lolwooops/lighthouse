Mini project II


Project flow structure
-grabbed keys
-pulled from yelp first; limited by 4[] pull limit from yesterday
-pulled edmonton and calgary coffeehouses
-set up sql with sqlalchemy
-pulled from foursquare
-had to spend a lot of time researching/troubleshooting how to deal with formatting
-realized by the end of it most of them were going to be franchised stores
-removed them and counted whatever the two apis could catch


-explore endpoint was able to catch some ratings for 4[] but not a lot


results
-discounting tim hortons, starbucks, second cup out of 50 ea
-lower numbers for yelp in edmonton
	-heard  that yelp only captures locations with votes
	-maybe edmonton people vote less
	-maybe yelp caught more fast food places in that area
-since no rating from 4[], here are top 10 coffee shops in calgary and edmonton
	-seems like significantly more 5* in calgary

used a package from python called folium
folium makes it easy to visualize spacial data, provides interactive maps that kinda function like google maps
mapped the coffeehouses; red is yelp, green is 4[]
for both apis i didn't use lat/long so that might explain why the results seem so clustered
	-could also be because the apis count from different areas differently and got caught by the 50 limit


favorite api
-better api is definitely yelp, data is easily accessible, not a lot of nesting
-4[] json pulls are disgusting and very nested, requires a lot of cleaning 
-also yelp delivers ratings more easily


challenges
-definitely most time consuming thing was dealing with 4[] limit from yesterday
-also lots of reading and researching to deal with bad format
-found some cool stuff, like RenderJSON and could use .pop to take a whole nested section out
-50 pull limit sucks

if more time
-originally i was going to pull coffeeshops from calg edm fortmac banff jasper and red deer, which i actually did; restarted proj
-way easier to compare the apis and see their coverages 
	-rather than @ 50 limit like here
-also heard that you can get rating by using premium pulls from 4[] or by repulling venue_id endpoint after an initial explore endpoint pull
