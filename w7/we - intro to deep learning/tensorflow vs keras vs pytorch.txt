2 types of deep learning frameworks
-low level - mathematical operations and neural network primitives are implemented (tensorflow, pytorch)
-high level - low level primitives used to implement neural network abstractions (models and layers) (keras)

TensorFlow is low-level and Tensorflow 2.0 uses Keras as its high-level API through tf.keras
