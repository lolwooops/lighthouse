need to deploy model 
-can try to get best model possible in notebook or script
-> must hand it in in a way that client can run it easily

cons of flask
-allows to use low quality code -> bad web application
-scalability - handle reqs one at a time (slow)
-modules -> 3rd party involvement = security breach
