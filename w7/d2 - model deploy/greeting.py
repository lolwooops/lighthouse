# The class Greet contains only one method â€“ get. This time the naming 
# convention is strict (we can use only HTTP request methods: get, post, 
# put, ...). Inside the get method, we initialize RequestParser() 
# which allows us to parse optional arguments. We create only one 
# optional argument name as a string type. In the variable name, we 
# store an argument value that was passed by calling our API. If the 
# user doesn't pass the argument name in an API call the value of the 
# variable is NULL. We also create different greetings based on the 
# value in the name variable.

# Now that we have our class created, we need to assign an endpoint. 
# The functionality of the Greet class will be available in the /greet endpoint.

# assign endpoint

# greeting_api.py is called directly (not imported as a module from another 
# script).
