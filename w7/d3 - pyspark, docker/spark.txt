spark - computing engine + set of libraries for parallel data processing

hadoop -> linear processing of huge dataset
spawk -> fast performance, iterative processing, real time analytics, graph processing, ml

can choose multiple languages
dataframe abstraction wiht obj oriented methods for transformations, joins, filters
easy conversion (eg, topandas())


difficult to t une and maintain
debugging - memory errors and errors within user defined fn hard to track down
cant guarantee max parallelism
