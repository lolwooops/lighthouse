containers

isolates application and dependencies -> can run anywhere

contrainers package up user space -> more lightweight than VM
(VM = container + kernel + virtual hardware)

docker
-ease of use
-speed
-docker hub
-modularity, scalability


engine - runtime and tooling
-manages containers, images, builds

client = UI
daemon - executes commands sent to docker client (building, running, distributing)
volumes - data part of container, initialized when created
-> destroy, update, rebuild container, data volumes untouched

docker creates network interfae so container can talk to lhost + attach IP to container + execute processes
