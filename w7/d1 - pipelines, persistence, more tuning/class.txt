pipelines, model persistance
pipeline typically for things that apply "fit+transform"


feature unions
pipelines let us specify seq of steps 
what if we need branches in process
-> FeatureUnion (uses concat to do things in parallel)

pipelines easily visualized by html



hp tuning with pipelines
need double __ when calling inside pipeline
-> pipeline__scaler


serialization
-want to keep training model and final model separate

pickle
process where python obj converted into byte stream
stores objects

---pickle is version dependent (model with 1.1 sklearn, pickle model, update to 1.3 sklearn, load pickle might have issues)


joblib (alt to pickle)
-faster, more efficient at storing large numpy arrays
python3.8+ - pickles more efficient
