recommender engines

typically uses ab testing

content based vs collab
content based - use knowledge of ea item to recommend a similar one
-works without user reviews/hebaviour
-requires desc data of products, doesnt expand user interests
collab based - use knowledge of users past purchases selections to recommend what similar users did
-works without desc product data
-difficult to make recommendations to new users

-define item features
-define distance metric
	-euclidean distance (geometric distance btw 2 points)
	-cosine similarity (angular distance)
-learn a distance metric?
  -learn relative feature importance, accoutn for feature interactions
  -requires some sort of supervision for training


movie feature engineering
-sounds - effects, music, dialogue
