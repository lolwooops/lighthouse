apriori - association rule mining

Support
support refers to the popularity of item and can be calculated by finding the number of transactions containing a particular item divided by the total number of transactions.
Confidence
Confidence refers to the likelihood that an item B is also bought if item A is bought. It can be calculated by finding the number of transactions where A and B are bought together, divided by the total number of transactions where A is bought. 
Confidence is similar to Naive Based Algorithm.
Lift
Lift refers to the increase in the ratio of the sale of B when A is sold.
lift = 1 → There is no association between A and B.
lift < 1→ A and B are unlikely to be bought together.
lift > 1 → greater the lift greater is the likelihood of buying both products together.

-set min value for support and confidence 
-extract all subsets having higher value of support than min threshold
-select all rules from subsets with confidence higher than min threshold
-order rules by desc lift
