-more weather data
   	-wind speed
	-air density
	-temperature?? (too hot??)

-use all data - try iterative training using pickles
-xgb_model (file name of stored xgb model or 'Booster' instance) â€“ 
Xgb model to be loaded before training (allows training continuation).
-rf -> warm_start
    
-efficiency 
   	-pipelines
