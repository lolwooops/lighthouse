time series

for ml - predictions made for new data when actual outcome may not be known - future being predicted but all prior obs are treated equ

for ts - adds explicit order dependence btw obs
-time = constraint and structure providing info

future is completely unavailable and must be estimated from what has already happened


components of time series - level, trend, seasonality, noise

concerns of forecasting
-how much data available
-time horizon of predictions req (short med long)
-can forecasts be updated freq over time or must they be static
-temporal freq are forecasts req

data provided at freq too high/unevenly spaced requires resampling
outliers bad
missing - interpolate/impute


irregular time series = data generated as burst/varying time intervals (account deposits from atm)

only 1 variable varying over time = univariate time series
multi = mutlivariate time series


deterministic time series
-expressed explicity - no random
-described for all time in terms of a taylor series exp provided all of its derivatives are known at some arb time

nondeterministic time series
cannot be described by analytic exp
-info necessary to describe not avail
-nature of generating process is random


stationarity
statistical properties (mean var autocorr) do not depend on time
-trend
-cyclicality
-seasonality
