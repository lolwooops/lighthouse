SNA
-building a network  - represent network? what are nodes/edges
-tie strength - how to identify strong/weak ties in network
-key players - identify strong/weak nodes in network
-cohesion - measures of overall network structure

directed network - displays who contact ea other
undirected network - who knows who
-adjacency matrix becomes symmetric

tie strengths - weights
-freq of interaction
-number of items exch
-indiv perceptions of strength of relationship
-costs of communication or exch (distance)
-combinations

preferential attachment
-property of networks where during evolution and growth in time, great majority of new edges are to nodes with an already high degree - degree of these nodes thus increases disproportionaltely, compared to most other nodes in the netowrk
--> result is a network with few very highly connected nodes and many nodes with low degree - long t ailed degree distribution
-populatiry
-quality
-mixed


graph theory alg
centrality
-degree, betweenness, closeness
degree - count of how many edges are connected to each node - node with high degree centrality (high # edges) = highly active node - eg. busiest airport
-assigns importance score based on # links
-how many direct - one hop - connections each node has
-finding connected individuals

betweenness centrality - measurement how often particular node lies on shortest path btw 2 other nodes - high btwness = removing node increases distance btw other nodes
-measures # times a node lies on shortest path btw other nodes
-which nodes are bridges btw nodes in a network
-for finding indiv who influence flow around a system

cloeness - measure of proximity of node to other nodes - high closeness can broadcast info quickly - used in studies to recognize indiv in positions to control info and resources within org
-scores each node based on closeness to other nodes
-calcs shortest paths btw all nodes then assigns ea node a score based on sum of shortest paths
-for finding indiv best placed to influence the entire network most quickly

eigencentrality
-measures nodes influence based on # links it has to other nodes in netwrok - also takes into account how well connected a node is - how many links their connections have etc
-by calc the extended connections of a node - identify nodes with influence over whole network
-good allaround SNA score 

page rank
-variant of eigencentrality - assign nodes scores based on their connections and their connections' connections
-also takes link direction and weight into account so links can only pass influence in one direction and pass diff amounts of influence
-measure uncovers nodes whose influence extends beyond their direct connections into wider network
-takes into account direction and connection weight, can be helpful for understanding citations and authority
