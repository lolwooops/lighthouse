GANs are a type of unsupervised learning trained via self supervised learning
-main use case = classify whether something is real or not (eg fraud identify)
involdes 2 sub models - generator -> generates new examples, discriminator -> classifying generated examples are real from domain or fake from generator model

generator = forger - learns distribution of classes
discriminator = investigator - learning boundaries btw classes, formal shape of dataset

GANs - keyadvantages
-solve generating data 
-no human supervision
