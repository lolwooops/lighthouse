market basket analysis - data mining technique
unsupervised learning
basis for recommender engine

generally used in retail industry

support
-given all transactions, suport is the % of transactions that contain a given item combination - often combination that fall below a support threshold are ignored in further analysis 
confidence
-given item A is purchased, whats the chance that item C is bought (conditional probability)
lift 
-suppose data shows that items a and c are occurring togehter in many transactions, do a and c have an association or are they occuring together by chance
