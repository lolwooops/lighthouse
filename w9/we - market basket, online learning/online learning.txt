online learning - allows us to update our models in real time
-refreshing ml models - done in batches

They manually train on newer data, and deploy the resulting model once they are happy with its performance
They schedule training on new data to take place, say, once a week and automatically deploy the resulting model


but want a model to learn+ predict in real time



online stochastic gradient descent
